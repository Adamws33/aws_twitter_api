# Welcome to my Twitter API

This app was created to retrieve 100 tweets,and display those over 10 pages.  Make the tweets filter in alphabetical order ascending and descending.  The pages can be switched between or chosen individually.  

This full stack application was built with React client and a Node.js and express back end.  You will need to update the /server/routes/tweets.js with your own Twitter credentials.  


## Client

    npm install
    npm start

## Server
